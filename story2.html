    <h3>Mundir's Story</h3>
    
    <p>Born in Ludhiana, India Chai has always been a part of my roots. I recall that on a cold wintery day, the first sip of chai warmed me up. Yet on hot summer days it cooled me down. </p>

    <p>Arriving to America the winters were a lot colder, seeing snow for the first time gave me the chills. The warmth from my chai gave me the comfort and warmth. Throughout my life I’ve been told I should develop a chai concentrate. I listened.  I’ve been so pleased that I can share the flavors I grew up sipping with my fellow Chai lovers.</p>
    <p>The First Sip of Chai uses the finest organic teas, organic aromatic spices and adds a whole lot of love to create the perfect Chai to give you this authentic Chai experience.  </p>
