  <p style="float: right">Born in Ludhiana, India. Chai has always been a part of my roots. I recall that on a cold wintery day, the first sip of chai warmed me up. Yet on hot summer days it colled me down.</p>

  <p>Arriving to America the winters were a lot colder, seeing snow for the first time gave me the chills. The warmth from my chai gave me comfort. Throughout my life I've been told I should develop a chai concentrate. I listened.</p>

  <p>I've been so pleased that I can share the flavors I grew up sipping with my fellow Chai lovers.</p>
